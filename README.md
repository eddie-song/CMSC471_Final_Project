## Visualization Description

This interactive visualization presents a comprehensive view of AI evolution through three main components:

1. **Interactive Timeline**: A chronological journey through key AI milestones and breakthroughs, allowing users to explore significant events in AI history. The timeline serves as a central navigation element, with each event providing context about important developments in the field. As users progress through the timeline, the other visualizations update dynamically to reflect the state of AI at that point in time.

2. **Three Interactive Charts**:
   - **U.S. Dollars Per Compute**: Shows the cost efficiency of computing power over time, measured in GFLOP (billion floating-point operations). This chart demonstrates the exponential decrease in computing costs, highlighting how technological advancements have made AI development more accessible. Users can click on specific data points to see detailed information about computing milestones.
   
   - **AI Training Parameter Size**: Displays the growth in model complexity through parameter counts across different AI domains. This visualization categorizes models by their primary domain (Language, Vision, Games, etc.) and shows how model sizes have evolved over time. The logarithmic scale helps illustrate the dramatic increase in model complexity, from early models to modern behemoths like GPT-4.
   
   - **AI Benchmark Performance**: Illustrates AI performance relative to human benchmarks across various tasks. The chart sets human performance as the baseline (zero) and shows how AI systems have progressed from initial performance (-100) to surpassing human capabilities in certain domains. This visualization helps users understand the rapid advancement of AI capabilities in different areas.

3. **2025 Metrics Dashboard**: An additional interactive visualization that shows detailed performance metrics of various AI models across different tasks in 2025. This dashboard provides:
   - Company-specific filtering to compare models from different organizations
   - Individual model performance tracking
   - Detailed task descriptions and scoring explanations
   - Visual comparison of model capabilities across various benchmarks
   - Interactive tooltips with specific performance metrics

## Work Distribution

   - For this project, each team member contributed an even amount to each part of the project. For the proposal, we generated ideas for visualizations and datasets to use together. During meetings in class, we all helped to present our own project's proposal and progress and review other groups' proposals and milestones. When developing the visualization, we each worked on separate parts of the projects and then combined them into a singular file. Once combined, we each made changes to the project as we saw fit.
